# ‚åöÔ∏è WheelLog.Garmin 

A WheelLog companion for Garmin smartwatches

This app is a rebuild from ground-up of an original Garmin app. I made this app to be with better UI, alarms working, and also settings sync from WheelLog app.

Btw here is the original app repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/marccardinal/WheelLog-Garmin-ConnectIQ).

Also here is my [fork of WheelLog](https://github.com/GGorAA/WheelLog.Android), which works with this companion.

## üõ† Development/Building

To build the app, go to properties.mk and set path to the developer key. After that, you can just run `make build` to build the app. To run it in a simulator, run `make run`. There is also a command called `make rerun`, which is not waiting for a simulator to start, but only runs the app in a simulator. You can also build for every device using `make buildall`, and you will have a binary for every device in `bin` folder. For publishing to the Connect IQ Store, use `make package`. And lastly, to clean, use `make clean`.
